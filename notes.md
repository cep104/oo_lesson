INTRO TO OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING 

##What is OO Programming?
 -Encapsulates both data and behavior for a common group of things. 

 -mimic real world situations 


##what does OO look like? 
-class
-instantiation  => .new
-methods/ behavior 
-attributes/properties => readers/writers

##Classes 
-a group of objects that all share the same behaviors 
- blueprint for the objects we are creating
- behaviors objects and class can use 
- customizable 
- class/end & name of class has to be capitalized 
end

##Objects 
instances of classes 
every object we create is going to have a unique id 
everything is an object in ruby 

##Methods
behaviors a class could have 
class methods => perform on class as a whole, behavior that belongs to a class (seeing all of the objects in a class) 
instance methods => belongs to objects we are creating in the class, called on the instance 


##Variables 
- local variables = scope is the method that it is defined 
- instance variables = syntax: 1 @ / scope: class 
- class variables = syntax: 2 @@ / scope: entire class/ to keep track of all the instances in a class ex. @@all
- global variable = defined outside of a method/ accessible by entire file / not recommended to use.
